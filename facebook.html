 <h3>Welcome to the Facebook learning tool guide.</h3>
      <p>Facebook is a social media platform used by over 2.45 billion people on a monthly basis, it is a social media platform where students can very easily interact with their teachers, and vice versa. Facebook is available on the App Store, Google play and also browser. There are many features that are available for use on Facebook in which contribute to teacher-student interaction, one of them being videos. </p>
      <p> Long length videos can be uploaded to Facebook meaning that online lessons can be uploaded. The live feature on Facebook can also be used for live lessons, this feature includes viewers being able to comment whilst one is broadcasting, for questions or whatever may be the caseâ€¦ A Facebook feature which I believe can greatly contribute to teaching and learning is the group making feature. On Facebook, groups can be created and only those invited can join and view what has been uploaded directly to the group.  Teachers can use this feature to specifically add each class group to a specific Facebook group. Teachers would have the ability to post Photos, Videos and even statements directly to the group. </p>
      <p> During the leaving cert my Politics and Society teacher used the group feature, and I must say it worked well as we were able to share posts relating to the subject and further discuss the subject. Now keep in mind that a Facebook group is not the same as a messenger group chat. Which gets me to my next point, Facebook developers have in the recent years developed the messenger app, which is a separate app used for chatting to your Facebook friends. That way students and teachers are able to directly message one another.</p>
      <p> To use Facebook, one must be at least 18 years of age, which may be an issue for students who may be under 18. You must create an account to use Facebook, which requires either a phone number or an email address, a password and further information such as birthdate and gender.</p>
