      <h3>Welcome to the Snapchat learning tool guide.</h3>
      <p>Snapchat is a social media app that Is used by up to 210 million people daily. It is used for mostly sending and receiving pictures/videos. Snapchat would be a great teaching and learning tool as it is very straight forward and easy to understand. Snapchat contains multiple pages. The main page which is the one you see when you first log in and is the camera, this is where you can capture photos and videos and afterwards either post them to a story or send them to a friend. </p>
      <p> It is efficient considering it is fast and easy to navigate through. Snapchat contains certain features which I think can greatly contribute to teaching/learning. In Snapchat there are multiple features that can contribute to teaching/learning, one of them being the option to create a private story, meaning that you can select those in particular that you want to view the story, and you also have the option to name the story whatever you like! Teachers can use this feature to create stories with a specific group of students, i.e.</p>
      <p>Biology teacher can create a story that can be used to post biology related pictures/videos. Keep in mind that the story will only hold what is uploaded to it for 24 hours! Another Snapchat feature that can be used for teaching/learning is the ability to create group chats. In Snapchat chats, if a photo/video is sent from camera roll into the chat it can be saved by either the sender or receiver so it does not disappear after it is viewed. On the other hand if a snap was sent as a snap directly from the snapchat camera it can only be viewed once, however there is an option to replay the snap which is only there a few seconds after the snap is opened. </p>

      <p>The same applies for group chats. In Snapchat you are able to change your friends display names to whatever suits you, this does not mean that their username will be changed, only what their name appears as, to reveal username you must click into their profile. This can help teachers properly organise their students names into whatever suits them to avoid confusion. A snapchat users “Bitmoji” is their virtual character that is usually made to look like them, this can also help in differentiating students.</p>
